# Bitaxe Temperature Monitor and Auto-Tuner

This project contains a Python-based monitoring and auto-tuning application for the Bitaxe Gamma 601 Bitcoin solo miner. This tool dynamically adjusts operating frequency and voltage to achieve optimal hash rate while preventing overheating.

## Overview

The **Bitaxe Temp Monitor & Auto-Tuner** continuously polls the Bitaxe's `/api/system/info` endpoint to monitor current temperature, hash rate, and voltage. Based on configurable parameters (target temperature, interval, voltage step, etc.), the script automatically adjusts:

  - **Frequency**: Decreases frequency if the temperature exceeds the target or increases it if the temperature is well below the target.
  - **Voltage**: If frequency adjustments alone are insufficient or at their limits, voltage is also adjusted within safe operating ranges.

The app aims to maximize the miner's hash rate while maintaining stable and safe operation.

## Features

  - **Automatic Auto-Tuning**: Continuously monitors the Bitaxe's performance and temperature.
  - **Dynamic Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts frequency and voltage in real-time based on temperature and hash rate.
  - **Dual-Mode Operation**: Run as a desktop GUI or a headless web server.
  - **Docker Support**: Includes `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` for easy deployment.
  - **Graceful Shutdown**: Listens for interrupt signals (Ctrl+C) and exits safely.
  - **Customizable Parameters**: Easily modify settings such as target temperature, sample interval, and safe operating limits.
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Raspberry Pi**.

### ü™ü Windows

1.  Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

2.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andewkuehne/bitaxe-temp-monitor.git
    cd bitaxe-temp-monitor
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-----

### üçé macOS

1.  Open a terminal window.

2.  Install Homebrew (if not already installed):

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

3.  Install Python 3 and Tkinter:

    ```bash
    brew install python
    brew install tcl-tk
    ```

4.  Add this to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.bashrc`):

    ```bash
    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
    export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/tcl-tk/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/tcl-tk/include"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/tcl-tk/lib/pkgconfig"
    ```

5.  Apply changes:

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bash_profile
    ```

6.  Clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andewkuehne/bitaxe-temp-monitor.git
    cd bitaxe-temp-monitor
    ```

7.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### üêß Linux

1.  Open a terminal window.

2.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andewkuehne/bitaxe-temp-monitor.git
    cd bitaxe-temp-monitor
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-----

### üçì Raspberry Pi (RPi 5)

1.  Open a terminal window.

2.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andewkuehne/bitaxe-temp-monitor.git
    cd bitaxe-temp-monitor
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-tk
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The application can be run in two different modes.

### 1\. Desktop GUI (Default)

To launch the desktop application, run the script without any arguments. This is ideal for managing a miner on your local machine.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 2\. Headless Web Server

To launch the web interface, use the `headless` argument. This is perfect for remote servers.

```bash
python3 main.py headless
```

Once running, access the interface from a web browser at `http://<your_server_ip>:5000`.

## Deployment with Docker (Recommended for Servers)

Using Docker is the best way to run the web server for a stable, long-running deployment.

### Prerequisites

  - You are on a Linux server with **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.

### Steps

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd bitaxe-temp-monitor
    ```
2.  **Launch the container:**
    Run the application in detached mode (`-d`) to have it run in the background.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3.  **Access the Web Interface:**
    Navigate to `http://<your_server_ip>:5000` in your web browser.

### Managing the Docker Container

  - **View Logs:** `docker-compose logs -f`
  - **Stop the App:** `docker-compose down`
  - **Update the App:** After a `git pull`, rebuild and restart with `docker-compose up -d --build`.

-----

## How It Works

1.  **Initialization**: Applies the initial voltage and frequency settings to the Bitaxe.
2.  **Autotuning Loop**:
      - Continuously polls the Bitaxe API.
      - Decreases frequency or voltage if the temperature exceeds the target.
      - Increases frequency or voltage if temperature is well below target and hashrate is low.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment**: Applies updated settings in real-time.
4.  **Graceful Exit**: On shutdown, the current state is logged and the app exits cleanly.

## Disclaimer

**WARNING:** This tool modifies hardware settings and may stress-test your Bitaxe. Although safeguards are in place, running the miner outside its standard operating parameters can pose risks. Use this script at your own risk. The authors are not responsible for any damage to your hardware.
